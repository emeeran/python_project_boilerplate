### **Project Name: Python Project Boilerplate.**

**Description.:**

The Python project boilerplate aims to automate the creation of necessary directories and files, saving time and ensuring adherence to best practices. This Python project boilerplate expedites project setup by automatically generating directories such as'src' and 'tests', along with files like 'README.md' and '.gitignore', all following best practices. This tool saves developers time by automating project setup tasks and ensuring consistency in projects by enforcing standardized directory structures and file formats. This enables developers to dedicate more time and attention to actual coding tasks instead of spending valuable time setting up project structures and files. Developers can promptly commence work on their projects without the need to configure project structures, allowing for seamless project initiation. It saves developers time by quickly setting up a clean and organized project structure from the start, promoting better project management practices. This tool aims to enhance efficiency and productivity for developers by automating project setup, reducing manual tasks, and promoting standardized project configurations.
